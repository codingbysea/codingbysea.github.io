<h2>A Topic Description List</h2>
<p>I will choose a short news from New York Times, WSJ, Washington Post or the Mercury News (San Francisco) hopefully everyday and translate it into Chinese. 
  Then I will collect 10 new words and put them in an Android app. The app will help you memorize and understand the words. You can download it from google play. 
  It is currently free, but it may change in the future version. </p>
